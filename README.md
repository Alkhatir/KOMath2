Matrix operations for matrices, for which each entry is a function $f_{i,j} : R \to R$

- Implement (point-wise) addition and multiplication of such matrices
- Implement function evaluation for such matrices
- Handle exceptional cases, e.g. when the addition is not defined, as the dimensions of the matrices do not agree
